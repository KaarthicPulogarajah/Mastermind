# Mastermind
Play Mastermind against the computer!

The computer generates a sequence of 4 unique colours from a total of 6 possible colours.
The player's role is to use logic and strategy to determine the sequence. The player initially makes a guess of the colours, and 
the computer responds by evaluating the guess and displaying a key of up to 4 numbers. The numbers are in no particular order
and are either 1 or 2.

1 means a colour is correct, but in the wrong spot, and a 2 means a colour is correct and in the right spot. The player must use this
information to make additional guesses and eventually determine the correct sequence within 10 turns.
